# PGCrypto for ActiveRecord ðŸ†Š

[PostgreSQL PGCrypto](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgcrypto.html)
support for ActiveRecord models.

![Don't roll your own crypto](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cryptography.png)

## About

The goal of this project is to provide a simple and efficient encryption
support for your application records.

Main goals:
 * No _magic_ please
 * No DSLs please
 * Less code, less maintenance
 * Good docs and test coverage
 * Keep it up-to-date (or at least tell people this is no longer maintained)

The available features include:
 * PostgreSQL `pgcrypto` native symmetric encryption using the
   [attribute serialization](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/AttributeMethods/Serialization/ClassMethods.html#method-i-serialize) API and Arel API.
 * Logger support for sensitive data query obfuscation.

### A bit of history...

The project was born after trying out `crypt_keeper` and having to deal with
the broken support for PostgreSQL where the stored data would be invalid for
native SQL functions.

I would like to thank Justin for his work, but I decided to move away from the
original work for arguably subjective reasons and the critical importance of
this functionality in my projects.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'active_record-pgcrypto'
```

And then execute:

```ruby
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```ruby
$ gem install active_record-pgcrypto
```

## Usage

To start using it with ActiveRecord/Rails, add this to an initializer and
configure your keys:
```ruby
# config/initializers/pgcrypto.rb
require 'active_record/pgcrypto'
# Replace the default environment variable name with your own value/key.
ActiveRecord::PGCrypto::SymmetricCoder.pgcrypto_key = ENV['PGCRYPTO_SYM_KEY']
 ```

Now enable the coder for your model attributes:

```ruby
class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  serialize(:email, ActiveRecord::PGCrypto::SymmetricCoder)
end
```

NOTE: In order for the encrypted data to be store the column must be of type `binary`.

The coder provides a simple API to help you provide search support by
leveraging the Arel API:

```ruby
class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  serialize(:email, ActiveRecord::PGCrypto::SymmetricCoder)

  def self.decrypted_email
    ActiveRecord::PGCrypto::SymmetricCoder
      .decrypted_arel_text(arel_table[:email])
  end
end
```

Now you can use add it to your `ActiveRecord::Base#where` queries:

```ruby
MyModel.where(MyModel.decrypted_email.matches('keyword%'))
```

## Development

Build the Docker image first:

```
docker build -f Dockerfile -t active_record-pgcrypto/ci ./`
```

Now you can run the tests:

```
docker run -v `pwd`:/gem -it active_record-pgcrypto/ci
```
